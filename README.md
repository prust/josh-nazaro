## Future Mark

You are Simeon Jonason, a follower of religious firebrand, Josh Nazaro. Two religious groups and one political group have hired assassins to take out Josh; your job is to protect him and, if possible, to take out the assassins.

Future Mark is a top-down 2D sci-fi action game.

TODO:

* If the bullet collides with the player & his shield isn't up (or isn't in the right direction), lose a life
* Display the number of lives (starting at 3) in a corner of the screen
* Pause the game & show a Game Over message when lives = 0
* Make the sniper(s) move less (& less erratically)
* Add Josh Nazaro
* Add the rest of your team

The AI characters will need to:
* see bullets coming and attempt to evade them
* aim at people based on their current trajectory
* calculate a path to an exit point or to a designated sniping point
