## Josh Nazaro

You are Simeon Jonason, a follower of religious firebrand, Josh Nazaro. Two religious groups and one political group have hired assassins to take out Josh; your job is to protect him and, if possible, to take out the assassins.

I'm currently focused on the gameplay and the controls right, so there aren't currently graphics -- just colored rectangles representing you, enemies, obstacles, etc.

To play, download the LOVE engine from https://love2d.org/ and run `> love "."` from inside this repository.

TODO:

* Injure/disable enemies when bullets hit them (bullets shouldn't bounce off them)
* Pause the game & show a Game Over message when lives = 0
* Display the number of lives (starting at 3) in a corner of the screen
* Add Josh Nazaro
* Add the rest of your team

The AI characters will need to:
* see bullets coming and attempt to evade them
* aim at people based on their current trajectory
* calculate a path to an exit point or to a designated sniping point
